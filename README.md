This is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage and track their tasks efficiently. The application provides functionality to add, edit, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks, with the tasks being saved in local storage for persistence across page reloads.

Mark as Complete: Tasks can be marked as completed by checking a checkbox next to them.
Delete Tasks: Tasks can be deleted from the list.
Edit Tasks: Users can edit the text of existing tasks.
Local Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.
Validations: If a user tries to add an empty task or a duplicate task, appropriate validation messages are shown.

Technologies Used: 

HTML: For structuring the layout and creating the user interface.
CSS: For styling and ensuring responsiveness of the application.
JavaScript: For DOM manipulation, task management, event handling, and local storage.
